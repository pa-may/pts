          <p class="question">What is the difference between a guard dog and a protection dog?</p> 

          <p class="answer">
            The answer is important for you to know the difference before you make a decision and buy a puppy. Think of it this way, a guard dog will guard your property and a protection dog will protect you and your family.
           </p> 

           <p class="answer">
            A guard dog is trained specifically to be a working dog, not a pet. They are used as police dogs or military dogs and cannot "turn off" their training. Guard dogs can be trained to work at 3 distinct levels of security.
          </p> 
          <p class="answer">
            Alarm Dog- This is a large breed with a deep, threatening bark. He will sound the alarm when someone approaches, but will take no action. In many cases, the alarm dogs bark is enough to deter unwanted visitors.
          </p> 
          <p class="answer">
            Sentry Dog- A guard dog used as a sentry is most often used to guard the outside of a large property, such as a warehouse or shipyard. The dog is free to roam on his own without instruction from his owner. Because they are trained to attack anyone who trespasses, they are the best possible protection for this type of situation.
          </p>
           <p class="answer">
            Attack Dog- An attack trained guard dog is trained to attack and even kill when given the command of his handler. These dogs meant to be used as police K-9 or military service dogs. Dogs trained at this level are not sociable at any level and are not suitable as pets.
          </p> 
          <p class="answer">
            Protection dogs are family dogs that will protect and defend their family in any situation they feel is threatening. Some of the most popular breeds for protection are Rottweilers, German Shepherds and Giant Schnauzers. The Doberman is the only working dog bred specifically as a protection dog. These breeds are extremely loyal and become true family members. They can be socialized with children and other pets, as well as other family, friends and neighbors. These dogs should never be trained specially to do what comes naturally to them. They should be bred with special consideration for their natural instinct to protect. These breeds do however, need to be obedience trained and need to know their position in the family. They can be dominant, so it is important to establish your alpha role. Exercise is extremely important if you want to have a well behaved, well-adjusted protection dog. These dogs need plenty of activity because they are big, physical animals with lots of energy.
          </p> 
          <p class="answer">
            The main distinction between a guard dog and a protection dogs is ultimately in the training. It is always best to seek a professional when you have determined what you need from your working companion.
          </p> 

          <p class="question">Are protection dogs safe?</p> 
          <p class="answer">
            Are protection dogs safe?
A well trained protection dog is much safer than a dog that has had no training. This is due to the fact that much like every human can punch, every dog can bite. However, a trained family protection dog understands right from wrong, and when biting is or is not allowed. A trained protection dog will understand that biting is only allowed when their handler gives them permission to do so, and will also reliably release on command. In contrast to this, and untrained dog will bite on impulse. If effectively trained and handled, a protection dog is very safe.
           </p> 

           <p class="question">If i buy fully trained protection dog from PTSK9, will it be OK with my children, other pets and animals?</p> 
           <p class="answer">Yes! Part of our matching process ensures that your dog will be OK with everyone in your household. Our personal protection dogs are raised in homes around children and conditioned to be loving and tolerant. We socialize and train our dogs not only with other dogs of all sizes, but also with other animals including birds, horses, cats and rabbits (upon request)</p>
